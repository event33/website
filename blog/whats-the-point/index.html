                    ill be talking about s**cide, and depression. maybe dont read my first post
                    if you cant handle that</p>

                <p>over the last couple of months, maybe a year now ive been completely living in loneliness, no friends, no family, just me
                    with my stuff, my computer, my mouse, my keyboard, my kitchen and ive been feeling more and more depressed.
                    i recently went to a doctor he gave me more anti-depressants and pills that shouldve worked but to no avail, of course.<br><br>

                    and just two days ago i tried to commit suicide, i dont feel like i have a reason to live, everyone around me left me cuz
                    i was "always angry", annoying, "little brat", passive-aggresive and i dont know what to do. i turned back to the internet after
                    leaving like three years ago because of toxicity, and bullying against me. i think ill try to be alive still. since writing this makes
                    me feel a little more hopeful, but only a little because i dont see a reason for me to keep living.<br><br>

                    not a valid one atleast. ive just created accounts on some platforms and i got a like on one of my replies to a post which
                    i actually for the first time in some time felt a small bit of joy?? over a like? i dont know, but i like it and hopefully
                    i get some friends here, with the same interests as me, and the same hobbys.<br><br>

                    i dont have much else to say, but i hope i can get through this even tho i want to end it all sometimes...
